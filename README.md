1. About

A short paragraph to introduce the project:

FlightDA provides a live journal-style analysis of flight datasets using Python and Jupyter. It explores flight performance metrics, trends, and visualizations to assist data analysts in understanding air travel patterns.

2. Features

Highlight what the notebook includes—feel free to modify based on the actual content:

Loading and cleaning flight datasets.

Descriptive statistics (e.g., average delays, on-time performance).

Visual trends by airline, day, time, and more.

Maps or calendar heatmaps (if present).

Insights and next steps documented within the notebook.

3. Usage

Explain how to run and interact with it:  
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nareshsemwal/FlightDA.git
   cd FlightDA
2.Make sure your environment is ready:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Launch the notebook:

jupyter notebook 1.Flight\ Data\ analysis.ipynb

Follow the steps inside the notebook to load and explore the data.

### 4. **Data**
Clarify where the notebook gets its data:
- Does it fetch from public sources like Kaggle or open airports data?
- Is there a `data/` folder?
- Example:
  > The notebook loads data from `data/flights.csv`, sourced from [source_link]. If you'd like to recreate or extend, download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory with the same filename.

---

### 5. **Dependencies**
List the required Python packages:
```markdown
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- folium (if maps are used)
- jupyter
```
And mention creating a virtual environment or using requirements.txt.

6. Getting Started

Walk through the high-level workflow:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, unify formats).
3. Create visualizations (delay distribution, flight volume over time, etc.).
4. Interpret findings through markdown commentary.
   
7. Contributing

Invite collaboration:
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. Make improvements or add analyses.
4. Commit (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`), push (`git push origin feature/my-feature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure any added code is documented and reproducible.
